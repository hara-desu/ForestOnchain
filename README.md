# 🌳 Forest Onchain

**Forest Onchain** is a smart contract project inspired by the popular web2 app **Forest** — a productivity tool based on the **Pomodoro Technique** that helps users stay focused and build better work habits.

This on-chain version brings the same concept to Web3, introducing **transparency, automation, and gamified incentives** through blockchain technology.

---

## ⚙️ Core Concept

The **Pomodoro Technique** divides focused work into timed sessions (typically 25–60 minutes), followed by short breaks.  
In **Forest Onchain**, every session and break is tracked and enforced by smart contracts.

To ensure fairness and automation, the contract uses **Chainlink Automation** to trigger the end of each focus session automatically.

## 🌿 Features

- **Custom Categories:**  
  Users can create categories for different focus areas — for example, _Study_, _Work_, _Exercise_, etc.

- **Timed Sessions:**  
  Within each category, users register focus sessions ranging from **20 to 60 minutes**.

- **Mandatory Breaks:**  
  A short break is required after each session to maintain balance and prevent burnout.

- **Progress Tracking:**  
  The app tracks how much time each user has focused per category.

---

## 🪙 Goals and Staking

- Users must set **focus goals**, defining:

  - The number of sessions to complete.
  - The deadline for completion.
  - The amount of ETH to stake as motivation.

- **Goal success:**  
  If the user completes all sessions within the deadline, their staked ETH is returned.

- **Goal failure:**  
  If the goal is not met in time, the staked ETH is used for charity to grow trees.

- The **stake amount** is proportional to the number of trees (sessions) the user plans to grow.

---

## 🌲 The Forest Grows

After each completed session:

- A **virtual tree** is grown, representing your focus and progress.
- The more sessions you finish, the denser your on-chain forest becomes.
- Missed goals still contribute to the global tree count — ensuring that every bit of effort contributes to growth.

- **Automation:** Chainlink Keepers (Automation)
- **Framework:** Foundry (for development and testing)
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum / Layer 2 compatible
